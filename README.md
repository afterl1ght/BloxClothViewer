# Requirements
- **For Android:**
    - Requires Android 9.0 (API 28) or higher.
    - Tested on a (borrowed) Samsung Galaxy A03.
    - Supports OpenGL ES 3.0 and higher.
    - 2GB of RAM should do the trick.
    - Compatible with both ARMv7 and ARMv8 architechures.
- **For iOS:**
    - This is already gonna be supported, but my iPad decided to get wet, so it's not here yet. I want to make sure it runs well on it.
- **For Windows:**
    - Tested on Windows 10 and 11. Theoretically runs well on Windows 7, not sure about older versions.
    - 64-bit only.
    - Tested on Intel UHD Graphics and Intel Xe Graphics.
    - Supports OpenGL ES 3.0 and higher.
    - I believe most PCs can run this.
- **For Linux:**
    - Untested so no downloads yet.
- **For MacOS**
    - Untested and I don't have a Mac so no downloads yet. I believe the current source code, if compiled, can run on a Macbook pretty well. (That doesn't mean I won't work on it, though!)
