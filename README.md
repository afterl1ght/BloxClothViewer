An Android app (later ported to Windows) that allows previewing classic Shirts and Pants for Roblox, making sure they match and seamless.

Made while eating tofu so everything's all in light mode, please beware.

Only Classic Shirt and Classic Pants can be previewed in this app in order to check for any errors that might have occurred during creation. In order to check for any potential issues with Layered Clothing, it would be preferable to use your 3D modeling program as well as Roblox Studio.
If you don't know what Classic Shirt and Pants are, Roblox has categorized 2D Shirts and Pants as Classic to make way for 3D Layered Clothing.

# Features
- Classic Shirt and Classic Pants texture support in various casual image formats (JPEG and PNG formats are greatly recommended)
- A grey R6 character model for testing your clothing to its best accuracy
- Hand-drawn UI
- Cool and slightly infuriating grid
- cat girl
- Color picker to customize scene and character model
- *Very cool outline*
- Does not give bobux
- Solves issues that can be solved by using Studio (which Mobile users might not have access to) unless there's some effort at play...

# Requirements
- **For Android:**
    - Requires Android 9.0 (API 28) or higher.
    - Tested on a (borrowed) Samsung Galaxy A03.
    - Supports OpenGL ES 3.0 and higher.
    - 2GB of RAM should do the trick.
    - Compatible with both ARMv7 and ARMv8 architechures.
- **For iOS:**
    - This is already gonna be supported, but my iPad decided to get wet, so it's not here yet. I want to make sure it runs well on it.
- **For Windows:**
    - Tested on Windows 10 and 11. Theoretically runs well on Windows 7, not sure about older versions.
    - 64-bit only.
    - Tested on Intel UHD Graphics and Intel Xe Graphics.
    - Supports OpenGL ES 3.0 and higher.
    - I believe most PCs can run this.
- **For Linux:**
    - Untested so no downloads yet.
- **For MacOS**
    - Untested and I don't have a Mac so no downloads yet. I believe the current source code, if compiled, can run on a Macbook pretty well. (That doesn't mean I won't work on it, though!)

    - Pinch with two fingers to zoom in or out.
 - **For laptops, PCs and workstations alike (Windows, Mac, etc.):**
    - Rotate the model by pressing left mouse button and move around.
    - Move camera by pressing middle mouse button (mouse wheel) and move around.

# Extra Information
- This is made using **Godot 3.4.4**.
- My friends like this. I appreciate it. I hope you like it too.
- In case you wanna donate, I did think of it, but it feels selfish earning money from a simple app anyone can build.

(Update 12/18/2022)
- If you want to preview Classic Clothing in Roblox Studio, one of the ways I know is to upload the Classic Shirt/Pants texture onto Roblox, then use those texture as **Shirt** and **Pants** texture.

- Another way would be to access Roblox Studio local files and replace some local textures, then you can test it locally (even without internet). I haven't used it for a while though, so I'm not sure if this method works anymore.

I;m sorry I can't provide you much useful information. If you want to use this app though, it's all yours.
